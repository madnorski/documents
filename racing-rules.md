# Race Series

The race series will consist of 6 scheduled races in January and February.  Races will be held on Tuesday nights when conditions allow.

Thursday nights will be make-up race nights when conditions do not allow a Tuesday race.  Make-up race nights may be held when races are missed, conditions allow, volunteers are available, changes can be effectively communicated, and venue reservations can be made, but are not guaranteed, given the many variables involved.

## Format

Races use a mass start format, with racers self-seeding themselves based on expected finish time, technique, etc.  We offer events of either a 5km or 10km distance using either classic or freestyle ski technique.  Events are further broken down by gender, so a given race has 8 events:

* Women’s 5km Classic

* Women’s 10km Classic

* Women’s 5km Freestyle

* Women’s 10km Freestyle

* Men’s 5km Classic

* Men’s 10km Classic

* Men’s 5km Freestyle

* Men’s 10km Freestyle

## Format Changes

When weather or other conditions require, the race course may be modified and/or shortened to work with the available snow.  We prioritize racer safety and quality, competitive course conditions and may adjust a given race to ensure we can achieve those goals.

In instances where we use a significantly shortened course -- such as when we’re racing on a 1km man-made loop -- we may have all racers ski a shorter distance (e.g. 5km instead of 10km), but still score racers in their declared event distance for purposes of tracking season points.

If races have large turnouts, adjustments to race format, wave-based starts, or entry limitations, may further be required to accommodate.  If entries are limited, pre-registered season racers will always be allowed to compete and score points.

## Individual Competition

Individual skiers will score points in each race based on their place for their event in that race.

## Team Competition

The team competition allows between 3 and 5 racers to form a team.  A team must score 3 racers for a given race.  Teams must be formed and declared to the race director before the first race of the series to ensure fair drafting of teams.  If a racer is not part of a team but is  interested in the team competition, we will make our best efforts to draft them on to teams with unfull and open rosters, or form teams wholecloth from undrafted racers.

## Disqualification

Racers may be disqualified from event placement and thus scoring for various reasons.  Disqualification is ultimately at the discretion of race officials and course marshals.  Reasons for disqualification include, but are not limited to:

* Incorrect technique (e.g. taking more than 1 skate kick in a lane transition, skating through turns, or otherwise deviating from accepted classical technique in a classic-only event)

* Cutting the course (e.g. skipping laps, omitting sections of the course, not skiing fully around cones marking the course, etc)

* Unsportsmanlike conduct (e.g. intentionally interfering with any other racers, not yielding to faster racers when tracked, etc)

* DNF (e.g. dropping out of an event)

* Other forms of cheating that go against the spirit of competition.

If racers observe violations on the course they are encouraged to report issues to racing@madnorski.org.

## Fees

In an effort to keep ski racing affordable, we work to keep prices down.  Many thanks are due to our sponsors and volunteers who make our ski races possible.

Race series entry fees will be as follows:

### Single Race

Entry in a single race is $10 for club members, $15 for non-members, and $2 for youth and collegiate racers.

### Race Series

An individual can register for the entire race series (up to 6 races) for $50 for club members, $60 for non-members, and $10 for youth and collegiate racers.

### Teams

There is no additional fee to enter the team competition, but all racers on a team must also be pre-paid and registered for the entire race series.

### Published Pricing

These prices may be modified by a successful motion of either the over-arching club board or the race committee, but in all instances, the highest published price for a given season (published via the various Madison Nordic Ski Club outlets: blog, Facebook and other social media, website, email or mailing list, or printed posters) shall be considered official.

### Fee Usage and Refunds

Because many of our costs are fixed and because all of the proceeds from the race series and other club organized races are returned to the general fund to help with youth programs, education, club meetings, snowmaking, grooming, and many other expenses, entry fees for both the series and individual races are non-refundable.

We make best efforts to hold races when scheduled, and offer alternate race dates, when possible, but we are subject to the whims of nature and can only race when conditions provide safe, raceable snow of sufficient distance.  Please know that all of your race entry fees go to support and improve skiing throughout in the Madison area.

While race entry fees themselves are not a tax-deductible donation, MadNorSki is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit, and additional donations beyond race entry fees are both welcome and encouraged.

# Scoring

## Single Race

Racers are scored for their placement in the event they’re competing in at each race.  An event is the category or division a racer is in for their race and is comprised of their race distance, technique, and gender.  Men’s 10km classic and women’s 5km freestyle are examples of two discrete events.  Each event has its own 1st place through however many racers finish that event.

## Series Points - Individual

Series points are based on a racer’s place in each of the series’ races.  Fewer points are better.  Series points are calculated differently, depending on how many races are held in a given year, so racers may miss some races and still score.  Series point tabulation is as follows:

1. In years where only one race is held, there will be no series points.

2. In years where two races are held, racers will combine their points from both races.  Racers must ski both races to be eligible for series scoring.

3. In years where three races are held, racers will combine their points from their best two races.  This means a racer may miss one race or drop their worst score.

4. In years where four races are held, racers will combine their points from their best three races.  This means a racer may miss one race or drop their worst score.

5. In years where five races are held, racers will combine their points from their best four races.  This means a racer may miss one race or drop their worst score.

6. In years where all six races are held, racers will combine their points from their best four races.  This means a racer may miss two races and/or drop their two worst scores.

## Series Points - Team

Team points for a race are calculated based on the performance of the team’s 3 best racers.

### Ghost Racers

In races where a team has fewer than the required 3 racers competing, the team will earn points based on a "ghost racer" to round out their race roster.  The “ghost racer” will receive a number of points equal to the finisher count for the race event (events broken out as Men’s/Women’s, Classic/Freestyle, 5k/10k) with the highest finisher count plus one; equivalent to a racer finishing last in that event. 

For example, if a team had only one entrant for a given race and that racer competed in the Women’s 5k Classic event and got 2nd place, the team will receive a score based on their entrant’s place, plus 2 "ghost racers".  If the most deeply entered event for that race was the Men’s 10k Freestyle with 12 racers, the team’s score for that race would be 28 (2 + 13 + 13).

# Tie-Breaking

When possible, we want to have decisive wins for events and the overall series.  In some cases, ties cannot be broken in an equitable way, and a final tie decision may be declared, but the following guidelines apply to some tie-breaking scenarios.

## Individual Race

In the event of a visual tie at the finish line, the chief of timing shall be the final arbiter of who won.  Photography and electronic timing may be considered, but the chief of timing will make the final decision.

## Series Points - Individual

When racers who have tied on points have both competed in the same races, the racers’ cumulative times between all races will be used to break ties.

When racers who have tied on points have not competed in the same races, but both racers’ series scores are based on the same races, each racer’s cumulative times between the scored races will be used to break ties.

When racers who have tied on points have not competed in the same races and their series scores are based on some different races, the cumulative times between their overlapping races (e.g. races both racers competed in, which could be as few as one race) will be used to break ties.

If none of these criteria will break a tie, a final tie may be declared, though race officials are free to establish additional tie-breaking criteria as needed and having decisive winners is desired.

## Series Points - Team

If one team’s scoring is based on any number of "ghost racers" and the other team’s is not, the team which didn’t use “ghost racers” is the winner.

If the total number of event entries (e.g. the sum of the count of team racers for each race) for one team is great than the other, the team with more entries wins.  For example, if Team A and Team B are tied on points; and team A had 4 skiers in the first race and 5 in the second, while Team B had 5 skiers in the first race and 3 in the second; Team A would have 9 total entries for the series, and Team B would have 8 total entries for the series, making Team A the winner.
